## Cryptography and Security Exercises

### Overview
This repository contains solutions to various cryptography and security exercises. The exercises were part of an EPFL master course focusing on classical cryptography and its applications.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Return of the Imitation Game
- **Enigma Machine Simulation**: This exercise involved implementing and testing the Enigma cipher machine. My solution includes simulating the Enigma's encryption and decryption functionalities. *(This was my individual work.)*
  - **1.1**: Implement the decryption algorithm for the Enigma cipher.
  - **1.2**: Given an Enigma state and a ciphertext, recover the UTF-8 plaintext.
  - **1.3**: Given partial information, recover a secret message encrypted with the Enigma cipher.

#### Exercise 2: SCIPHER
- **Tweaked ElGamal Cryptosystem**: Involves implementing a decryption process for a modified ElGamal cryptosystem.
  - **2.1**: Implement decryption for the tweaked ElGamal Cryptosystem.
  - **2.2**: Modify ciphertexts in a specific way without changing certain components. *(Completed by my teammates.)*

#### Exercise 3: Steganography: Caesar meets Vigen√®re
- **Steganography and Cryptography Combination**: This exercise combines steganography with ancient cryptography techniques.
  - **3.1 & 3.2**: Decrypt two given ciphertexts to get hints for the next question.
  - **3.3**: Discover an English passphrase hidden in an image. *(Completed by my teammates.)*
